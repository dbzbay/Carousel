# E-BAY CAROUSEL CLONE
The carousel displays images and information for items that are related to the currently viewed item. The carousel renders dynamically based on user interaction with other components, but is fully capable of rendering on its own. The carousel uses ReactJS for frontend client-side rendering while the backend is built with an ExpressJS server and a remotely-hosted MongoDB Atlas database.
